This repository contains Dockerfiles and instructions for creating Docker containers for a Python and JavaScript project. Docker containers provide a consistent and reproducible environment for running your project, making it easier to develop and deploy across different systems.

To build Docker container, I use the following command:

sudo docker build -t kevinkimanzi/workshop1:v1.0.0 .
